# Architecture

Backend Architecture:

* Spring Boot 3
* Java 17
* PostgreSQL
* Flyway
* JPA / Hibernate
* JWT Authentication

Architecture Style:

Modular Monolith

Do NOT generate microservices.

Modules should remain isolated inside a single Spring Boot application.

---

# Space Concept

The system revolves around Spaces.

Space Types:

* PG
* Mess
* Hostel
* Co-Living

Examples:

* PG-A
* PG-B
* Office Mess
* Hostel-A

A space is the top-level business entity.

---

# User Model

A User is an independent account.

A User can:

* Own multiple spaces
* Join multiple spaces
* Participate in multiple spaces simultaneously

Examples:

Ketan:

* PG-A (Owner)
* PG-B (Owner)
* Mess-A (Owner)

Rahul:

* PG-A (Tenant)
* Mess-A (Customer)
* Mess-B (Customer)

Never restrict a user to a single space.

---

# Membership Model

Use SpaceMembership as the relationship entity.

Relationship:

User
↕
SpaceMembership
↕
Space

Membership Roles:

* OWNER
* MANAGER
* TENANT
* CUSTOMER
* STAFF

Membership Status:

* INVITATION_SENT
* ACCEPTED
* ACTIVE
* INACTIVE
* REMOVED
* VACATED

A membership record must never be deleted.

Historical records must always be preserved.

---

# Authentication

Authentication Method:

* Mobile Number
* OTP Verification

No password-based login.

Future:

* WhatsApp OTP
* SMS OTP

---

# Invitation Model

Users cannot directly join spaces.

Workflow:

Owner creates invitation
↓
Invitation sent
↓
User logs in
↓
User accepts invitation
↓
Membership created

Invitation Status:

* PENDING
* ACCEPTED
* REJECTED
* EXPIRED

Use auditing support.

Use soft status changes instead of deletes.

Avoid hard deletes for business data.

* Meal Responses

Instead update status.
