### Space Type Rules ✅

#### PG / Hostel

Building → Floor → Room → Bed · Member → Bed

#### Co-Living

Building → Unit → Room → Bed · Member → Bed or Room

#### Rental

Building → Unit (optional Room) · Member → Unit

#### Mess

Members ✅ · Meals 🔶 (Phase 5–6 MVP) · Polls & headcount 🔶 · Billing 🔶 (Phase 7 — meal ledger + dashboard API)

### Occupancy Management ✅

* ✅ Allocate Member (Bed / Room / Unit by space type)
* ✅ Reserve Member (future move-in)
* ✅ Move In (reserved → active)
* ✅ Transfer Member
* ✅ Vacate Member
* ✅ Cancel Reservation
* ✅ Occupancy history
* ✅ OccupancyWizard (shared flow from dashboard, member profile, bed/room context)
* ✅ Contract snapshots — rent, deposit, food terms (4.3b)
* ✅ Dashboard **Residents** module card → bottom sheet (Move In · Reserve · Transfer · Vacate)

### Accommodation Status ✅

Available · Occupied · Reserved · Maintenance · Blocked

* ✅ Status on unit, room, bed forms and lists
* ✅ Status filter chips in occupancy wizard target picker
* ✅ MAINTENANCE / BLOCKED excluded from allocation picker

### Availability Management 🔶

* 🔶 Available / Occupied beds & rooms — counts in building summary header
* 🔶 Vacant units — aggregated in summary API
* ⬜ Dedicated availability / vacancy browse screen

### Capacity, Dashboard & Search 🔶

* ✅ Room & bed capacity (forms, quick setup)
* ✅ Structure metrics — building summary on accommodation home
* ✅ Text search on structure list screens
* ✅ Allocation-target search in occupancy wizard
* 🔶 Filter by building, floor, unit, room, status — hierarchy navigation + wizard filters only; no global structure filter UI
* ✅ Dashboard occupancy metrics — occupied/vacant beds, move-ins, pending payments (dashboard-summary API)

### Permissions ✅ (Phase 4.5)

Implementation: `spacePermissions.ts`, `useSpacePermissions`, `permissions-backend-spec.md`

| Role | Intended access | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **OWNER** | Full access | ✅ Server + UI |
| **MANAGER** | Operate, no structure delete | ✅ Server + UI |
| **TENANT** | Own allocation read-only | ✅ Tab hidden; My stay on dashboard |
| **CUSTOMER** | No accommodation/occupancy | ✅ Tab hidden; section hidden |
| **STAFF** | Structure read + occupancy list | ✅ Read-only FABs |

- `GET /spaces/my` `permissions` block preferred over local role matrix
- Accommodation tab gated by `canViewAccommodation`
- Stack screens wrapped in `RequireAccommodationAccess`
- 403 errors mapped via `permissionErrors.ts`

> **Backend spec:** [permissions-backend-spec.md](./permissions-backend-spec.md)

### Out of Scope (Phase 4)

Rent, billing, payments, deposits, complaints, maintenance tickets — handled in Phases 7–8. Meals & polls are Phase 5–6 (Mess).

---

## Phase 5 - Meal Management 🔶 Mess MVP in progress

> **Architecture:** [meals-phase-5-backend.md](./meals-phase-5-backend.md) · [meals-phase-5-ui-integration.md](./meals-phase-5-ui-integration.md) · [meals-phase-5.2-menu-planning.md](./meals-phase-5.2-menu-planning.md) · [meals-phase-5-menu-library-architecture.md](./meals-phase-5-menu-library-architecture.md) · [payments-phase-7-dashboard.md](./payments-phase-7-dashboard.md)
>
> **Scope:** Mess spaces only. PG/hostel food-in-rent uses participation hooks; full meal tab is Mess-first.

### Menu library (master data) ✅

* ✅ Food categories & food items (veg / non-veg / eggless)
* ✅ Meal combos (library CRUD, pricing, item composition)
* ✅ Menu library screen (Items · Combos tabs, inline chip editors)
* ✅ Combo / item deactivate

### Meal participation ✅

* ✅ Meal plans (FULL, breakfast-only, etc.)
* ✅ Enroll / pause / resume / stop participation
* ✅ Member meal access toggle (Mess customers & profile)
* ✅ Eligibility summary per date & meal slot
* 🔶 Tenant food-included via occupancy contract (backend wired; UI on move-in flows)

### Daily menu planning ✅

* ✅ Menu planning hub (date nav, per-slot cards: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner)
* ✅ Plan meal screen — select combos, kitchen notes, copy yesterday
* ✅ Draft / publish per slot
* ✅ Inline combo price edit (library price updates on blur / save)
* ✅ Share menu preview (numbered WhatsApp-style message)
* ✅ Today's menu (read-only)
* ✅ Meals tab quick entry (planning as tab root for managers)
* ⬜ Weekly menu planning & bulk week copy

### Delivery locations 🔶

* ✅ CRUD API + `MealDeliveryLocationsScreen` (name, description, active/inactive)
* ✅ Used in poll responses, headcount breakdown, member activity day sheet
* 🔶 Linked from Menu Planning only — not a first-class dashboard module
* ⬜ Address / landmark field (separate from description)
* ⬜ Edit location, reorder list, dedicated quick action entry

### Operator dashboard (Mess) 🔶

* ✅ Attention required (tomorrow menu not planned / partial / ready to share / open poll)
* ✅ Financial snapshot (Expected Charges / Collected / Pending — backend API + client fallback)
* ✅ Meal operations (members receiving meals, menus published, open polls, today's headcount)
* ✅ Quick actions (Meals · Members · Payments shortcuts)
* ✅ Unified PG accommodation operations on non-Mess spaces

### Member profile — Meals tab ✅

* ✅ Meal activity calendar & history (accepted / pending / amounts / payment status)
* ✅ Day detail bottom sheet (selections, delivery, payment review)
* ✅ Profile consolidates Documents & Notes (no separate top-level tabs)

> ~~Dashboard **Meals** module card is stubbed~~ — **Done for Mess:** operational dashboard + quick actions. PG spaces still use Residents card only.

### Not started / deferred (Phase 5)

* ⬜ Weekly menu planning
* ⬜ Menu history reports (beyond per-member activity)
* ⬜ Special meal requests
* ⬜ Dedicated meal consumption analytics

---

## Phase 6 - Availability & Polls 🔶 Core delivered

> **Handoff:** [meals-phase-6-handoff.md](./meals-phase-6-handoff.md)

### Meal availability polls ✅

* ✅ Open / close poll per meal slot (auto-open on share)
* ✅ Numbered menu options + “Not available” synthetic option
* ✅ Multi-quantity polls (when enabled on space)

### Response collection 🔶

* ✅ In-app member responses (`MealPollResponseScreen`, dashboard poll card)
* ✅ Delivery location per response
* 🔶 Payment choice (pay now / pay later) + proof upload + owner approve/reject
* ⬜ Payment approval/rejection remarks (owner → member)
* ⬜ Payment history timeline per member
* ⬜ WhatsApp response ingestion (share text only; no inbound parsing)

### Headcount engine ✅

* ✅ Day summary (`GET /meals/headcount?date=`)
* ✅ Per-meal breakdown (options, no-response members, delivery by location)
* ✅ Headcount bottom sheet (menu planning + dashboard)
* ✅ Owner dashboard — tomorrow headcount chips & remind members

### Member meal activity & billing signals 🔶

* ✅ Monthly activity API (accepted / pending / generated / paid / pending amounts)
* ✅ Per-day detail with slot amounts and payment status
* ✅ Space-wide billing rollup (`GET /spaces/{id}/dashboard-summary`, `GET /spaces/{id}/payments/ledger`)

### Forecasting & reports ⬜

* ⬜ Daily / weekly forecast
* ⬜ Food wastage report
* ⬜ Attendance / consumption trend reports

---

## Phase 7 - Payment Management 🔶

> **Architecture:** [payments-phase-7-dashboard.md](./payments-phase-7-dashboard.md)
>
> **Principle:** Stabilize **Mess billing and meal payment workflow** before PG rent collection. Expected/Collected math must not change every time a new billing model is added.

### Dashboard & ledger (MVP) ✅

* ✅ Payments tab (member ledger, filters, month nav — OWNER/MANAGER)
* ✅ Unified financial cards (Expected Charges / Collected / Pending) on dashboard + payments
* ✅ Backend ledger + dashboard-summary APIs (Mess meal activity, PG occupancy, hybrid)
* 🔶 Client fallback when API unavailable (404/network)

### Mess billing standard 🔶 (highest priority)

CountIn uses **two billing concepts only** — not four separate products:

| Type | Label | Dashboard cards |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `PAY_PER_MEAL` | Pay per meal | Expected · Collected · Pending |
| `PREPAID_BALANCE` | Meal balance | Balance sold · Balance used · Balance left |

Subscription, credits, and hybrid are **not separate enum values**. Prepaid balance covers both “30 meals @ ₹3,000” and “₹3,000 recharge” via `prepaidBalanceUnit` (`MEALS` | `CURRENCY`). When balance runs out, `prepaidFallbackToPayPerMeal` switches to pay-per-meal automatically — no `HYBRID` billing type.

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Space billing type field + migration (V59) | ✅ |
| `GET/PUT /spaces/{id}/meal-billing-settings` | ✅ |
| `SpaceBillingService` calculator branching | ✅ |
| Edit Space billing UI (Mess owners) | ✅ |
| Dashboard cards branch by billing type | ✅ |
| Per-member billing override (V61) | ✅ |
| Member balance wallet (sold/consumed/remaining) | ✅ |
| Pay-per-meal overflow when balance empty | 🔶 Fallback + PAY_LATER day payment |

### Meal payment workflow 🔶

* 🔶 Pay now / pay later + proof upload + owner approve/reject (Phase 6)
* ⬜ Approval/rejection remarks
* ⬜ Payment history timeline (audit trail per member)
* ⬜ Payment reminders

### PG / accommodation payments ⬜ (deferred)

* ⬜ Rent collection recording (amount, date, mode: cash / UPI / bank transfer, remarks)
* ⬜ Occupancy collected amount on ledger (today: expected only; collected = null)

### Other ⬜

* ⬜ Deposit management (member profile ✅; space-level collections ⬜)
* ⬜ Advanced payment reports (Phase 9)

---

## Phase 8 - Complaints & Notices ⬜

* ⬜ Complaint Management
* ⬜ Notice Board
* ⬜ Notifications

---

## Phase 9 - Reports & Dashboard 🔶

* 🔶 Unified space dashboard (Mess ops + PG accommodation ops + financial snapshot)
* 🔶 Accommodation dashboard metrics (occupied/vacant beds, move-ins, pending payments count)
* ⬜ Occupancy reports (PG)
* ⬜ Payment reports
* ⬜ Meal reports & advanced business dashboard

---

## What’s next (recommended order)

CountIn's strongest area today is **meal planning and availability**. Complete Mess billing logic before PG rent collection — otherwise dashboard Expected/Collected cards keep shifting.

| # | Track | Phase | Why now |
|---|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Mess billing models** | 7 | Space-level billing type unlocks stable Expected/Collected for all Mess flows |
| 2 | **Delivery locations module** | 5–6 | Headcount and delivery planning already depend on it; screen exists but needs polish |
| 3 | **Meal payment workflow** | 6–7 | Finish approve/reject loop (remarks + history) before a new rent module |
| 4 | **Weekly menu planning** | 5 | High daily operator value; day-by-day planning already works |
| 5 | **PG rent collection** | 7 | Reuse meal payment patterns; occupancy expected already wired |
| 6 | **Reports & analytics** | 9 | Needs stable billing data first |

### Mess operators (current focus)

1. **Delivery locations** — address field, edit/reorder, dashboard quick action
3. **Meal payments** — remarks, timeline, then reminders
4. **Weekly menu planning** — week view + bulk copy
5. **Consumption / wastage reports** (after billing stable)

### PG / Hostel (after Mess side stabilizes)

1. **Phase 7** — Record Payment (rent collection API + UI)
2. **Phase 4.5** — availability browse screen, structure filters

### Where to start implementation

See [payments-phase-7-dashboard.md §10](./payments-phase-7-dashboard.md#10-implementation-sequence) for the first backend + frontend tasks.

**Foundation shipped:** space default + per-member billing override, member balance wallet, mixed mess dashboard. **Next:** delivery locations polish and pay-per-meal overflow UX.
