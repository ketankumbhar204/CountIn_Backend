## Phase 4 - Accommodation Management ✅ Core complete

> **Delivered:** 4.1 Structure CRUD · 4.2 Quick Setup & Builder · 4.3 Occupancy lifecycle · 4.3b Contract snapshots · Dashboard Residents module card
>
> **Remaining polish (4.5):** real dashboard metrics, availability browse screen, permission tab gating, structure list filters

### Goal

Manage physical accommodation structure and occupancy across:

* PG
* Hostel
* Co-Living
* Rental

Mess spaces do not use Accommodation Management.

### Structure UI ✅

* ✅ Inline name edit on list rows (building, floor, unit, room, bed)
* ✅ Full edit screens for other fields
* ✅ Quick Setup wizard
* ✅ Manual Builder with lifecycle menus
* ✅ Bulk create (rooms, units, beds) and duplicate

### Property Structure ✅

* ✅ Edit Building
* ✅ View Building
* ✅ Deactivate Building

#### Floors

* ✅ Create Floor
* ✅ Edit Floor
* ✅ View Floor
* ✅ Deactivate Floor

#### Units

* ✅ Create Unit
* ✅ Edit Unit
* ✅ View Unit
* ✅ Deactivate Unit

#### Rooms

* ✅ Create Room
* ✅ Edit Room
* ✅ View Room
* ✅ Deactivate Room

#### Beds

* ✅ Create Bed
* ✅ Edit Bed
* ✅ View Bed
* ✅ Deactivate Bed

### Space Type Rules ✅

#### PG / Hostel

Building → Floor → Room → Bed · Member → Bed

#### Co-Living

Building → Unit → Room → Bed · Member → Bed or Room

#### Rental

Building → Unit (optional Room) · Member → Unit

#### Mess

Accommodation not applicable (Members, Meals, Availability, Billing)

### Occupancy Management ✅

* ✅ Allocate Member (Bed / Room / Unit by space type)
* ✅ Reserve Member (future move-in)
* ✅ Move In (reserved → active)
* ✅ Transfer Member
* ✅ Vacate Member
* ✅ Cancel Reservation
* ✅ Occupancy history
* ✅ OccupancyWizard (shared flow from dashboard, member profile, bed/room context)
* ✅ Contract snapshots — rent, deposit, food terms (4.3b)
* ✅ Dashboard **Residents** module card → bottom sheet (Move In · Reserve · Transfer · Vacate)

### Accommodation Status ✅

Available · Occupied · Reserved · Maintenance · Blocked

* ✅ Status on unit, room, bed forms and lists
* ✅ Status filter chips in occupancy wizard target picker
* ✅ MAINTENANCE / BLOCKED excluded from allocation picker

### Availability Management 🔶

* 🔶 Available / Occupied beds & rooms — counts in building summary header
* 🔶 Vacant units — aggregated in summary API
* ⬜ Dedicated availability / vacancy browse screen

### Capacity, Dashboard & Search 🔶

* ✅ Room & bed capacity (forms, quick setup)
* ✅ Structure metrics — building summary on accommodation home
* ✅ Text search on structure list screens
* ✅ Allocation-target search in occupancy wizard
* 🔶 Filter by building, floor, unit, room, status — hierarchy navigation + wizard filters only; no global structure filter UI
* 🔶 Dashboard occupancy metric — placeholder value; not yet wired to summary API

### Permissions 🔶

Implementation: `accommodationPermissions.ts`, `occupancyPermissions.ts`

| Role | Intended access | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| **OWNER** | Full access | ✅ | Structure CRUD, deactivate/delete, quick setup, occupancy manage |
| **MANAGER** | Operate, no structure delete | ✅ | Create/edit structure, duplicate, bulk, occupancy manage; deactivate/delete owner-only |
| **TENANT** | Own allocation read-only | 🔶 | Can view own occupancy on member profile (`canViewMemberOccupancy`); cannot manage occupancies; accommodation tab not role-restricted yet |
| **CUSTOMER** | No access | ⬜ | `canViewAccommodation()` returns true for all roles and is unused; accommodation tab visible to every role |
| **STAFF** | Limited read | 🔶 | Can view space occupancies (`canViewSpaceOccupancies`); no structure write or occupancy manage; structure browse is read-only via missing FAB |

**Occupancy write** (allocate, reserve, transfer, vacate): OWNER and MANAGER only (`canManageOccupancy`).

**Structure deactivate / delete:** OWNER only (`canDeactivateAccommodation`).

**4.5 remaining:** hide accommodation tab for CUSTOMER; restrict TENANT to own-allocation views; enforce `canViewAccommodation` at tab and screen level.

> **Backend spec:** [permissions-backend-spec.md](./permissions-backend-spec.md)
