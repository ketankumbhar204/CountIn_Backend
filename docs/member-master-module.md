# Member Master Module

## Goal

Allow owners and managers to manage members even if they do not install the CountIn app.

A Member is a business record.

A User is an application account.

A Member may or may not be linked to a User account.

Examples:

Tenant who never installs app
Customer who never installs app
Staff member who never installs app

must still be manageable inside CountIn.

# Feature 6: Link User Automatically

Future Ready Design

When a user registers:

Check:

mobileNumber

If matching active member exists:

Link:

member.userId = user.id

No duplicate member creation.

Do not implement automatic linking now.

Only keep database structure ready.
